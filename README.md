Summer 2018 Project 2: Dodge Challenge

For my second project I began to learn Unity and C# to widen my skills in computer programming. Dodge challenge is a minigame that involves 5 levels of increasing difficulty, where the user must dodge the cuboid obstacles by moving left and right as their character is simulataneously moving forward.
